# New weelam.ca
This repo is the code for the new [weelam.ca](https://weelam.ca).
The old design was bloated and the colours didn't match anywhere so I threw out the old design and completely redid it.
I'm now using Vite + SCSS + JSX (React) + React Router for frontend and routing.
For hosting I'm using a Raspbery Pi 5 (8GB RAM) running Alpine Linux and using Nginx.

## Running
### Running Locally
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

### Building
- `npm run build`

## Notice
For the favicon and thumbnail I used Adobe Illustrator 2026.
I used it since it is easiest for me, and I already have access to it through my school.
I do not support Adobe at all since they have exploited their customers many times as well as failed to report security vulnerabilites.
